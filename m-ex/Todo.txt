MUST DO
-change all onSwallow references to OFST_KirbyAbilityRuntimeStruct, dk's is here 800f0ff8
-modulate code to index kirby items @ 800f16f0
-note to self, the struct that contains pointers to the
ftDemo files has not been expanded! I believe
its right here 800beb70
-psInitParticle table might need to be expanded.
exists @ 804d0d58 and 804d0e5c. check notes for more info

MAYBE
-at the end of the ftData pointer table, there are some bits that
idk what they do. might have to modify this. codeline 800853dc interfaces w. this


IDEAS
-wolf up b hitting walls enters rebound?, ground rebound enters fall?

-css use icon positions

-investigate the queue effects function,s try to make char effects work
